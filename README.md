## Overview

This project is part of the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  The goal of this project was to take a static site that lacked responsive design and offline functionality and covert it to mobile-ready site complete with offline functionality via a service worker.


## Specification

The [template](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) for this project provided a robust starting point from which the mobile-ready site was built.


## How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer:

`$ git clone https://github.com/dbeckwith01/mws-restaurant-stage-1`

and follow the instructions below:

* In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.  If you have both Python 2.x and 3.x installed then us `py -m http.server 8000` or `py -2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. You can now see the live site.
